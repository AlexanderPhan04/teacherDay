lyryc:
I used to sit and dream, back in your class that day,
You talked about the world, and showed another way.
When my code went wrong, you’d smile and softly say,
“Try again, you’ll find your light someday.”

’Cause you’re the guiding star, shining through the night,
A sunflower in my heart — always facing light.
Time may fade away, but your words remain,
You gave me strength to try again.
